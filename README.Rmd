The vardiff R package is being developed to provide functions to create, analise, and get results from multiple Vector Auto-Regressive models at once, including comparing one against the others. It works specifically with the [vars](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vars/index.html) and [varutils](https://ricardo-semiao.github.io/varutils/) packages.

**Disclaimer:** this package is in the early most stage of life. It hasn't been thoroughly tested and can present several bugs. I don't recommend using it for large-scale projects, yet.

Please report any problems in my email (below) or as a github issue. Thank you!

Author: Ricardo Semi√£o e Castro (ricardo.semiao\@outlook).

## Introduction

The `split_cols()` and `split_data()` functions define a list of sub-datasets with different slicing and variables. 

The nature of the splits can be analised an compared using the functions `ggvar_values_shaded()` (historic values with split shading), `mapvar_acf()`, and `mapvar_ccf()` (comparing the auto- and cross- correlation functions of variables between splits).

Then, the var models can be fitted with `mapvar_var()`, using custom exogenous variables with `mapvar_exogen()`, and choosing lags with `ggvar_select_patch()`. Diagnostics of each model can be seen using `mapvar_fun()`, that returns pretty tables for summary statistics and varutils plots.

Lastly, the results can be seen and diff'ed using the `mapvar_causality()` (Granger tests), `mapvar_irf()` + `diff_irf()`, and `mapvar_fevd()` + `diff_fevd()`.

In the future, I intent to add functions for creating and diff'ing counterfactuals, and expand the package to other VAR-like objects.


## Installation

You can install the development version of vardiff from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ricardo-semiao/vardiff")
```

## Upcoming changes

* Finish building functions:
  * Finish the "setup" suite for functions.
  * Solve tidyselect R CMD check notes.
* Add tests with testthat and vdiffr.
* Start using rlang and glue APIs wherever possible.
* Give more info in help pages:
	* Give hints on how to work with results.
	* Direct to used methods like "see: ?vars:::predict".
	
Additional:

* Add package data and custom examples
* Solve some less important lintr and styler notes.
* Study importing whole rlang, ggplot2, and purrr.
* Add titles to patchworks plots


## Aditional informations

This package:

* Follows the [tydiverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
  * Using the [styler](https://styler.r-lib.org/) and [lintr](https://lintr.r-lib.org/) packages for style consistency.
* Will use [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) and [vdiffr](https://vdiffr.r-lib.org/) for automate tests.
* Uses [rlang](https://rlang.r-lib.org/) frameworks for _tidy eval_ and _rlang errors_.
